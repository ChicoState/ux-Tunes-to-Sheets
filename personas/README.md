Mike is a 26-year-old student in Los Angeles, CA, working toward a psychology degree at
UCLA. He loves spending time at the university, learning about how the mind works. But his real
passion is music. Mike is skilled at playing the piano and guitar and even enjoys experimenting
with electronic music. Mike uses public transportation to commute to school for an hour and a
half. During his commute, he listens to music by composers like Debussy and modern artists
like Jacob Collier. He's studying their styles and hoping to incorporate some of their techniques
into his music. Mike lives in a small apartment with two roommates, but he makes the most of
his space by using noise-canceling headphones to focus on his music and block out
distractions.
Mike spends a lot of time in the music hall on campus, where he likes to record himself playing
different instruments. He's really into music and always tries to make his recordings better. Even
though he's studying psychology, he hopes to combine his love for music with his knowledge of
the mind, maybe by using music to help people or by creating music that can affect how we feel
and think.
Mike is having a hard time balancing his schoolwork with his love for playing the piano. Even
though he wants to do well in his studies, he can't resist playing the piano. His roommates are
really supportive and often come to listen to him play, which makes him feel happy and like he's
part of a community. On top of everything, Mike is also working on a small side project - a music
blog where he talks about different pieces of music, hoping to inspire others and find people
who share his passion.

Jake
18 yrs old male from San Jose, California
Jake is a college student majoring in communication, but music has always been his passion. He plays guitar and has been self-teaching himself for over a year using online resources. He also loves composing his own songs and often collaborates with friends.
He is creative and curious, eager to try and learn new things. But also, he often gets frustrated when things don’t go as planned. His main goal is to create sheet music so that he can share them with others. He wants to improve his composition skills and make his music more accessible to others. Jake finds it difficult to convert their ideas into proper sheet music. He struggles with music notation and feels overwhelmed by the complexity of traditional music notation software. He must also learn how to accurately represent their musical ideas on paper.
Jake prefers a user-friendly and intuitive app that can simplify the process of turning their tunes into sheet music. He values features that allow for easy editing and playback of their compositions. He is also interested in tools that can help them understand music theory better and apply it to their work.

# Scenarios

Mike, a student at UCLA, is torn between his passion for music and his academic obligations. Despite the pressures of his psychology exam, he finds solace in playing the piano and dreaming of blending psychology with music. Balancing his passions becomes increasingly challenging as his exam date approaches, but seeking advice from his psychology professor gives him a renewed sense of purpose. With a newfound perspective, Mike learns to manage his time better, set achievable goals for his music blog and practice, and organize performances that blend his academic and musical worlds. He realizes that finding harmony between his passions helps him excel in his studies and deepens his connection to music, giving him a clearer vision of how he can make a meaningful impact in the world.

Jake decides to give the museScore app a try to help with his frustration over music notation. He’s impressed by the app’s user-friendly interface and intuitive features. After inputting a few of his guitar riffs, he quickly creates a basic sheet music version of his composition. He is thrilled to see his ideas represented on paper and appreciates the app’s playback feature, which helps him refine his work. This positive experience boosts his confidence and encourages him to use the app regularly.


Jessica focuses on introducing her students to music that captivates their interest and enhances their learning experience. Each week, she selects popular and age-appropriate songs, using tablets or computers to find and print accessible sheet music. By playing short clips of potential songs and involving students in the decision-making process, Jessica ensures they are excited about the material. This approach not only makes learning fun but also helps students appreciate the relevance of contemporary music while developing their musical skills.
