# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* Competitive analysis shows each option's **unique strengths and weaknesses**
	* Melody Scanner: multiple input/output options, solo instruments only, limited free version
	* PianoConvert: quick processing, piano only, limited free trial
	* MuseScore: large library and playback, no conversion, limited free version
	* Fiverr: Human transcribed music, inconsistent quality and speed
 * Heuristic evaluation of Melody Scanner showed key issues to address
	* **Incongruity** between how inexperienced users may expect something to work and how it actually works
	* **Error messages provide little insight** into actual source of error
	* Limited flexibility, lack of options in conversion process
 * Personas and scenarios further reinforce user preferences
	* Simple, easily understandable conversion process
	* **Unlimited, free access** to all features
 * Sketches and diagrams show how new design concepts are being put into practice
	* Simple, clean, understandable interface
	* Convenient, **instant access to conversion** from main screen
