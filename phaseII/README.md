# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

The Tune-to-Sheets project aims to simplify the often complex process of music transcription by providing a tool that converts audio into readable sheet music. This phase of the project focuses on refining user interactions and designing wireframes based on user feedback. The goal is to enhance usability, intuitiveness, and functionality in response to insights gathered from both internal evaluations and informal feedback sessions. Building on Phase I, which explored competitive analysis, persona development, scenario creation, and UI sketches, this phase targets external perspectives and wireframes designs to inform the next steps in development.


## Methods

To develop a clearer understanding of user needs and challenges, we employed three research methods:

**Cognitive Walkthrough.**

**Purpose**: The cognitive walkthrough method was used to identify any potential usability issues by observing how users (represented by personas) might interact with the wireframes to accomplish typical tasks. This method focuses on user knowledge and feedback at each step, revealing where guidance, error feedback, or visual cues may be needed.

**Procedure**: Four participants completed predefined tasks within the wireframes while responding to two core questions:

 - "Will the user know what to do at this step?"

 - "Will the user know they did the right thing and made progress toward the goal?"

This method allowed us to pinpoint specific areas where users might encounter confusion, providing a basis for design adjustments.

**Informal Feedback Session (n=65)**

**Purpose**: This session was conducted to gather broad user feedback on user expectations, suggested features, and anticipated frequency of use.

**Procedure:** During a live demonstration with a CSCI 430 class, students engaged with the Tune-to-Sheets prototype and answered questions on its potential use, expectations, and feature requests. Their feedback provided insights into both immediate usability and potential long-term features that could enhance the product’s appeal to a wider audience.

## Findings

**Cognitive Walkthrough**

 - Error Feedback: Users expressed a need for immediate error messages, especially during login. This would help them understand if they’ve entered incorrect information and provide quick guidance on how to resolve errors.

 - Enhanced Visibility of Sign-Up and Guest Access: Options for account creation and guest access were not immediately visible. Users suggested increasing the prominence of these options to help first-time users easily identify different login paths.

 - Confirmation Cues for Actions: Participants highlighted the need for visual confirmations (e.g., notifications) to indicate successful actions, such as uploads or navigation steps, allowing them to feel secure in their progress.

 - Guidance with Tooltips or Onboarding: Evaluators recommended implementing tooltips or a brief onboarding guide to introduce key features. This would help new users feel confident in navigating the tool and understanding its functionality.

**Informal Feedback Session**

 - Guest Login Option: Many evaluators suggested adding an option to log in as a guest, enabling users to explore basic functionality without committing to an account. This would also allow casual users to benefit from the tool without creating unnecessary barriers.

 - Anticipated Use Cases: Participants reported that they would use the tool for converting complex music pieces, suggesting that features supporting playback, editing, and customization would be useful.

 - Missing Features: Users recommended additional features such as tempo adjustment, key changes, and a simplified display mode, indicating a preference for tools that would allow for greater personalization.

**Suggested Features:**

 - History Tracking: Some users recommended a log or history feature that would allow them to track previous uploads and conversions.
Web View of Sheet Music: There was a strong preference for an in-browser display of the converted sheet music, allowing users to try the tool with no commitment.

 - Instrument-Specific Adjustments: Participants suggested that users should be able to select the type of instrument, tailoring the conversion output to the specific instrument used.

## Conclusions

Based on these findings, the following recommendations were developed to guide future design work:

**Refine Menu Navigation and Visibility:**

 - Navigation: Reorganize the main menu to provide clear, intuitive paths to core features, such as the file converter and editing options, on the homepage.

 - Enhanced Sign-Up and Guest Access: Increase the visibility of sign-up and guest access options to allow users greater flexibility in how they engage with the tool. A guest option will remove barriers for first-time users and support initial exploration.

**Improve Feedback Mechanisms:**

 - Error Feedback: Implement error messages that provide immediate, clear guidance on resolving login or input issues.
Confirmation Cues: Add confirmation prompts for actions, such as uploads or completed tasks, to reinforce users’ sense of progress and control.

**Expanded Pages for Key Functions:**
 - Enhanced Homepage: Redesign the homepage to incorporate onboarding, quick access to tutorials, and links to essential features, such as the file converter. This will support users in navigating directly to high-use areas and onboarding smoothly.

 - File Converter and Instrument Pages: Add dedicated pages for the file converter and instrument-specific settings, allowing for a more customizable experience that meets diverse user needs. These pages will offer tailored settings that improve transcription quality based on instrument type.

## Caveats

Despite the valuable insights obtained, there are some limitations to the research methods:
 - Limited Sample Size in Cognitive Walkthrough: With only four participants, the walkthrough may not capture all usability issues, especially as they relate to various user demographics and backgrounds.
   
 - Persona Accuracy: While the personas used were detailed, they may not represent the full range of potential users, potentially introducing some bias in findings.
   
 - Restricted Demographic in Informal Feedback: Feedback was collected from a single class cohort, limiting diversity in user experience and needs. To enhance reliability, future research should include a more demographically varied user base.
